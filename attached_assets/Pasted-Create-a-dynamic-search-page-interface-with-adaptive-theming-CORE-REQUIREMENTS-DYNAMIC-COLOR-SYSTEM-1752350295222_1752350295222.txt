	•	Maintain consistent color harmony within each session
	•	Store theme temporarily (session-based, not persistent)
	•	Generate complementary colors for text contrast and UI elements
FLEXIBLE LAYOUT APPROACH:
	•	Design components that adapt to existing app structure
	•	Use modular CSS classes that can integrate with current theme
	•	Flexible grid system that adjusts to container constraints
	•	Responsive breakpoints that work with existing navigation/UI
ADAPTIVE CARD DESIGN:
	•	Video cards with dynamic background overlays matching theme
	•	Gradient overlays that use session theme colors
	•	Accent colors for interactive elements (hover, focus states)
	•	Theme-aware text contrast for readability
	•	Adaptive shadow/glow effects using theme colors
INTEGRATION-FRIENDLY STRUCTURE:
	•	Component-based approach for easy integration
	•	CSS variables for theme customization
	•	Modular styles that don’t conflict with existing CSS
	•	Flexible positioning that adapts to parent containers
	•	Theme system that extends existing app colors
VISUAL CONSISTENCY:
	•	Maintain core layout principles while adapting to app theme
	•	Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy
	•	Smooth color transitions between theme changes
	•	Visual harmony with existing app elements
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
	•	Generate random HSL color values on initialization
	•	Create theme object with primary, secondary, accent colors
	•	Use CSS custom properties for theme application
	•	Implement smooth color transitions
	•	Ensure accessibility compliance across all theme variations
BEHAVIORAL NOTES:
	•	New color theme each time user returns to search
	•	Maintain theme consistency during single session
	•	Adapt visual weight and contrast based on generated colors
	•	Preserve core UX patterns while varying aesthetics
