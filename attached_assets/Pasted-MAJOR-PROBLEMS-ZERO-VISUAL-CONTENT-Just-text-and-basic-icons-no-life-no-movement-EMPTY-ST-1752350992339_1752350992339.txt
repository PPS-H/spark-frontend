MAJOR PROBLEMS:
	•	ZERO VISUAL CONTENT - Just text and basic icons, no life, no movement
	•	EMPTY STATE DISASTER - Basic search icon + text is amateur level
	•	NO HUMAN ELEMENT - No faces, no personalities, no stories
	•	STATIC DESIGN - Everything looks frozen, no pulse, no energy
	•	GENERIC APPEARANCE - Looks like every other app, no unique identity
	•	MISSING SOCIAL PROOF - No trending content, no popular searches
	•	NO DISCOVERY MECHANISM - Users have no idea what to explore
